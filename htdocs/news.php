You can found <a href="http://http://01.webuda.com/">here</a> a _VERY_VERY_OLD_ release of this file searcher (the first, I think),
but the file searching works ;-)
<br>
<b>22/Apr/2011</b><br>
I'm working to turn UP the <b>File</b> searcher.<br>
Please wait a while.

Remain up the packages searcher :-)

Sorry for down site.<br>
I'd some problem with my server (during my vacation :-( ), so I migrated on an other provider.<br>
Unfortunatly, I've only 200MB for database and file search need 700M or more, and a large cpu usage, so I must disable this functionality.<br>
Until I use this server the SlakFinder 2 developing is freezed.<br>
Also I must disable statistics function, and restart counters.<br>
<br>
Good search to all!!

Sorry. Due limit spam I've disabled links in guestbook, so do not enter it.<br>
I finally chose the style for the new home that is under development.<br>
But now I go on vacation, so I cant continue to develop. Happy holidays to all!<br>
Thanks all for your contributes!!<br>

Thanks all for using SlakFinder!!<br>
In recent days I have been working to compact the list of repositories (already too long :-)), so it was a little space on the screen to add a board for news and a small <a href=gb.php>guestbook</a> for your feedback.<br>
<br>
<b>04/Jul/2010:</b><br>
Reached about a thousand of searches.<br>

<b>01/Jul/2010:</b><br>
Thanks all for use SlakFinder!! I hope it was useful to all.<br>
Thanks to all contributors (for bug and/or repository reportage)<br>
On behalf of all thank those who build new packages<br>
