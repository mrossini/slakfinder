After a very long downtime, file searcher turned up.<br/>
Well, now I've a lot of space on my hosting, so it works!<br/>
I've re-enabled guestbook and <a href="stats.php">statistics functions</a>.<br/>
Good search!!

Sorry for down site.<br>
I'd some problem with my server (during my vacation :-( ), so I migrated on an other provider.<br>
Unfortunatly, I've only 200MB for database and file search need 700M or more, and a large cpu usage, so I must disable this functionality.<br>
Until I use this server the SlakFinder 2 developing is freezed.<br>
Also I must disable statistics function, and restart counters.<br>
<br>
Good search to all!!

Sorry. Due limit spam I've disabled links in guestbook, so do not enter it.<br>
I finally chose the style for the new home that is under development.<br>
But now I go on vacation, so I cant continue to develop. Happy holidays to all!<br>
Thanks all for your contributes!!<br>

Thanks all for using SlakFinder!!<br>
In recent days I have been working to compact the list of repositories (already too long :-)), so it was a little space on the screen to add a board for news and a small <a href=gb.php>guestbook</a> for your feedback.<br>
<br>
